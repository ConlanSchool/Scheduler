My apologies for that mistake. Here's the corrected README file:

# Interview Scheduler

The Interview Scheduler is a React-based web application that allows users to book, edit, and cancel student interviews. 

## Features

- Appointment slots from Monday to Friday
- Create, edit, and delete interviews
- See the number of available slots per day
- Data is persisted by an API server using a PostgreSQL database
- Jest and Cypress are used for testing
- The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format

## Project Structure

The project has a well-structured tree with a breakdown of files and directories. Each file and directory has a specific purpose. The major directories include:

- src: Contains the main source code for the React application.
- __mocks__: Contains the mock modules for the tests.
- __tests__: Contains the test files.
- public: Contains the static files served by the application, including images.
- stories: Contains storybook stories for developing and testing UI components in isolation.
- coverage: Contains coverage reports generated by Jest.
- cypress: Contains integration tests using Cypress.

## Setup

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/<Your Github Username>/interview-scheduler.git
cd interview-scheduler
```

Then, install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

## Running Webpack Development Server

Start the webpack development server with:

```
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Running Jest Test Framework

Run the Jest test framework with:

```
npm test
```

This will run the unit tests in the application.

## Running Storybook Visual Testbed

Start the Storybook visual testbed with:

```
npm run storybook
```

This will let you view and interact with your UI components in isolation.

## Running Cypress Integration Test Framework

Make sure the application server is running in test mode, then start Cypress with:

```
npm run cypress
```

This will run the end-to-end tests in the application.

## Dependencies

- React
- Axios
- Node-SASS
- PropTypes
- Jest
- Cypress
- Storybook
```

This README file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions on how to set up, run, and test the project.
